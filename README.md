First mandatory exercise for Frameworks course

I've created a static json file in the persistance folder that i read from and write to, to simulate a database. 
This is done with filesystem module in node. 

As a data structure for posts and comments i chose redundancy instead of the foreign keys. 
This makes the data easier to manipulate and search.
